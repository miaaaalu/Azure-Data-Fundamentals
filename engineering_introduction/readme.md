## Data Operation 
* Data integration 
    * Data Integration involves establishing links between operational, analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems. 
* Data transformation 
* Data Consolidation. Data consolidation is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure - usually to support analytics and reporting. Commonly, data from operational systems is extracted, transformed, and loaded into analytical stores such as a data lake or data warehouse.

## Operational Data 
data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non-relational database. 

## Analytical data 
* data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting
* often in a data warehouse.

## Streaming Data 
* Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time
* often relating to specific events. C
* ommon sources of streaming data: 
    * internet-of-things (IoT) devices
    * social media feeds.

## Data Pipeline 
* orchestrate activities that transfer and transform data. 
* the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events.

## Data Lake 
* a storage repository that holds large amounts of data in native, raw formats. 
* Data lake stores are optimized for scaling to massive volumes (terabytes or petabytes) of data. 
* The data typically comes from multiple heterogeneous sources, and may be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.
