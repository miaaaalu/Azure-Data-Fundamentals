# Explore databases
## Relational databases 
Relational databases are commonly used to store and query `structured data`. 

* The data is stored in tables that represent `entities`, such as customers, products, or sales orders. 

* Each instance of an entity is assigned a `primary key` that uniquely identifies it; and \
* these keys(PK) are used to reference the entity instance in other tables. For example, *a customer's primary key can be referenced in a sales order record to indicate which customer placed the order.*

This use of keys to reference data entities enables a relational database to be normalized

## Non-relational databases
Non-relational databases are data management systems that `donâ€™t apply a relational schema` to the data. Non-relational databases are often referred to as `NoSQL database`.

There are four common types of Non-relational database commonly in use.

**Key-value databases**
* each record consists of a `unique key` and an associated value, which can be in any format.

**Document databases**
* a specific form of key-value database
* value is a JSON document (which the system is optimized to parse and query)

**Graph databases**
* store entities as nodes with links to define relationships between them.
